Here I am solving some programming problems. </br>
Every Problem has a separate folder-- </br>
with two file for each problem </br>
1. utils.py (For Functions of the program)
2. driver.py (To call the function) </br>
In the "test" folder, I am adding some testcases for each problem</br>

utils.py:

This file contains utility functions that are used to solve various programming problems.
Each function is designed to address a specific problem or perform a particular task.
The code within this file is reusable and modular, making it easier to maintain and test.
Examples of functions you might find in utils.py include sorting algorithms (like quicksort or mergesort), string manipulation functions, or mathematical operations.

driver.py:

The purpose of this file is to demonstrate how the utility functions from utils.py can be used.
It typically contains sample inputs, calls to the utility functions, and displays the results.
You’ll find examples of how to use the functions to solve specific problems.
For instance, if there’s a function in utils.py that calculates the factorial of a number, driver.py would show how to call that function with different input values.

Test Cases:

In the “test” folder, you’ll discover additional files associated with each problem.
These files contain test cases that verify the correctness of the utility functions.
Test cases cover various scenarios, edge cases, and expected outcomes.
By running these test cases, you can ensure that the functions behave as intended.

Let's break down some of the highlights:

* Need to work with dates? The `calender_module` has you covered.
* Got some funky rounding to do? Check out `floor_ceil_rint` for floor, ceiling, and rounding magic.
* Ever get lost in iterators and iterables?  I created helper functions in `iterators_iterables` to make working with them a breeze.
* For all your linear algebra needs, look no further than the `linear_algebra` module. 
* Calculating grades? The `marks_percentage` function is your friend.
* Want to analyze some data? `mean_var_std` will calculate mean, variance, and standard deviation in a snap.
* Removes duplicate characters from each substring,and logs the resulting substrings. I built a little `merge_tool` to automate that.
* Finding min and max values? That's what `min_max` is for.
* The `mutation` module contains functions for modifying data structures on the fly.
* Tired of plain old tuples? `named_tuple` lets you create fancy ones with names!
* There's also a `no_idea` file – works with matching and unique value. 
* `piling_up` handles accumulating data efficiently.
* Finding the second-highest value? Easy with the `second_max` function.
* Formatting strings is a breeze with the functions in `string_format`.
* Need to align your text perfectly? `text_alignment` has you covered.
* Working with time differences? The `time_delta` module is your go-to.
*  `validate_mail` ensures you only get valid email addresses in your system.
* And lastly, `word_order` tackles tasks related to processing and analyzing the order of words.

This is just the beginning!  I'm always adding new functionalities, so be sure to check back often.
